I HAVE THE POWER!!!

(power went out)

Had to borrow money from a friend and wait a night to get power. As I mentioned my car is destroyed so a new job is what will save me from my current life situation.

In the past I had avoided recruiting/consulting companies, wanted to get hired on directly by a company but on LinkedIn I would say like 80% of the job postings are by recruiting/consulting companies... so I'll filter duplicates but apply to them if qualified for the job. I'll also look into/rate the company.

I'm tired af right now can't code but I'm gonna work on the new version since I crashed my car and I don't have shit to do on my days off... I've been working everyday the last two months until I destroyed my car.

Gotta apply hard, make that cake, get to $0 net worth and get my ST/standard baby
